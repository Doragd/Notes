[One Time of Interaction May Not Be Enough: Go Deep with an Interaction-over-Interaction Network for Response Selection in Dialogues](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1001/)

* 主题：retrieval-based dialogues in open-domain
* 研究：context-response matching for multi-turn response selection based on publicly recognized benchmark data sets
* 当前存在的问题：SOTA require a response to interact with each utterance in a context from the beginning, but **the interaction is performed in a shallow way**
* 该工作：
  * let utterance-response interaction **go deep** by proposing an interaction-over-interaction network
  * The model performs matching by stacking multiple interaction blocks in which residual information from one time of interaction initiates the interaction process again. Thus, matching information within an utterance-response pair is extracted from the interaction of the pair in an iterative fashion, and the information flows along the chain of the blocks via representations.
* 效果：
  * Evaluation results on three benchmark data sets indicate that IoI can significantly **outperform state-of-the-art** methods in terms of various matching metrics.
  * we also unveil how the depth of interaction affects the performance of IoI.

[Incremental Transformer with Deliberation Decoder for Document Grounded Conversations](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1002/)

* 任务：Document Grounded Conversations
* 研究：generate dialogue responses when chatting about the content of a given document
* 当前存在的问题：document knowledge plays a critical role in Document Grounded Conversations, while existing dialogue models **do not exploit this kind of knowledge effectively enough** 
* 该工作：
  * propose **a novel Transformer-based architecture** for multi-turn document grounded conversations
  * we devise an Incremental Transformer to encode multi-turn utterances along with knowledge in related documents. Motivated by the human cognitive process, we design a two-pass decoder (Deliberation Decoder) to improve context coherence and knowledge correctness.
* 效果：
  *  Our empirical study **on a real-world Document Grounded Dataset** proves that responses generated by our model significantly outperform competitive baselines **on both context coherence and knowledge relevance.**
	
[Improving Multi-turn Dialogue Modelling with Utterance ReWriter](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1003/)

* 主题：multi-turn dialogue modelling
* 当前的一大挑战：**the frequently occurred coreference and information omission** in our daily conversation, making it hard for machines to understand the real intention
* 该工作：
  * propose **rewriting the human utterance as a pre-process** to help multi-turn dialgoue modelling.
  * Each utterance is first rewritten to recover all coreferred and omitted information.
  * The next processing steps are then performed based on the rewritten utterance.
  * To properly train the utterance rewriter, we collect **a new dataset with human annotations** and introduce **a Transformer-based utterance rewriting architecture using the pointer network.**
* 效果：
  * We show the proposed architecture achieves remarkably **good performance on the utterance rewriting task.** The trained utterance rewriter can be easily integrated into online chatbots and brings **general improvement over different domains.**

[Do Neural Dialog Systems Use the Conversation History Effectively? An Empirical Study](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1004/)

* 主题：Neural Dialog Systems
* 存在的问题：A common criticism of these systems is that **they seldom understand or use the available dialog history effectively.**
* 该工作：
  * we take an empirical approach **to understanding how these models use the available dialog history**
  * by studying the sensitivity of the models to artificially introduced unnatural changes or perturbations to their context at test time (在测试时人为地引入非自然变化或扰动其上下文的敏感性).
* 结论：
  * We find that both recurrent andtransformer-based seq2seq models are **not signifi-cantly affected** even by drastic and unnatural mod-ifications to the dialog history. 
  * by open-sourcing our code, we believe that it will serve as a useful diagnostic tool for evaluating dialog systems in the future.

[Boosting Dialog Response Generation](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1005/)

* 主题：dialog response generation
* 存在的问题：tend to **generate the most common and generic responses in the corpus** all the time.
* 该工作：
  * designed an iterative training process and ensemble method based on boosting.
  * We combined our method with different training and decoding paradigms as the base model, **including mutual-information-based decoding and reward-augmented maximum likelihood learning.**
* 效果：
  * Empirical results show that our approach can significantly **improve the diversity and relevance of the responses generated** by all base models, backed by objective measurements and human evaluation.

[Constructing Interpretive Spatio-Temporal Features for Multi-Turn Responses Selection](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1006/)

* 主题：Response selection
* 研究：Given the dialogue context, the goal of response selection is to identify the best-matched next utterance (i.e., response) from multiple candidates.
* 当前存在的问题：this task remains challenging due to **the huge semantic gap and also the large size of candidate set.**
* 该工作：
  * we propose a **Spatio-Temporal Matching network** (STM) for response selection.
  * soft alignment is first used to obtain the local relevance between the context and the response. And then, we construct spatio-temporal features by aggregating attention images in time dimension and make use of 3D convolution and pooling operations to extract matching information. 
* 效果：
  * Evaluation **on two large-scale multi-turn response selection tasks** has demonstrated that our proposed model significantly **outperforms the state-of-the-art model.**
  * visualization analysis shows that the **spatio-temporal features enables matching information in segment pairs and time sequences,** and have **good interpretability** for multi-turn text matching.
