* [One Time of Interaction May Not Be Enough: Go Deep with an Interaction-over-Interaction Network for Response Selection in Dialogues](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1001/)
  * 主题：retrieval-based dialogues in open-domain
  * 研究：context-response matching for multi-turn response selection based on publicly recognized benchmark data sets
  * 当前存在的问题：SOTA require a response to interact with each utterance in a context from the beginning, but **the interaction is performed in a shallow way**
  * 该工作：
    * let utterance-response interaction **go deep** by proposing an interaction-over-interaction network
    * The model performs matching by stacking multiple interaction blocks in which residual information from one time of interaction initiates the interaction process again. Thus, matching information within an utterance-response pair is extracted from the interaction of the pair in an iterative fashion, and the information flows along the chain of the blocks via representations.
  * 效果：
    * Evaluation results on three benchmark data sets indicate that IoI can significantly **outperform state-of-the-art** methods in terms of various matching metrics.
    * we also unveil how the depth of interaction affects the performance of IoI.

* [Incremental Transformer with Deliberation Decoder for Document Grounded Conversations](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1002/)
  * 任务：Document Grounded Conversations
  * 研究：generate dialogue responses when chatting about the content of a given document
  * 当前存在的问题：document knowledge plays a critical role in Document Grounded Conversations, while existing dialogue models **do not exploit this kind of knowledge effectively enough** 
  * 该工作：
    * propose **a novel Transformer-based architecture** for multi-turn document grounded conversations
    * we devise an Incremental Transformer to encode multi-turn utterances along with knowledge in related documents. Motivated by the human cognitive process, we design a two-pass decoder (Deliberation Decoder) to improve context coherence and knowledge correctness.
  * 效果：
    *  Our empirical study **on a real-world Document Grounded Dataset** proves that responses generated by our model significantly outperform competitive baselines **on both context coherence and knowledge relevance.**
	
* [Improving Multi-turn Dialogue Modelling with Utterance ReWriter](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1003/)
  * 主题：multi-turn dialogue modelling
  * 当前的一大挑战：**the frequently occurred coreference and information omission** in our daily conversation, making it hard for machines to understand the real intention
  * 该工作：
    * propose **rewriting the human utterance as a pre-process** to help multi-turn dialgoue modelling.
    * Each utterance is first rewritten to recover all coreferred and omitted information.
    * The next processing steps are then performed based on the rewritten utterance.
    * To properly train the utterance rewriter, we collect **a new dataset with human annotations** and introduce **a Transformer-based utterance rewriting architecture using the pointer network.**
  * 效果：
    * We show the proposed architecture achieves remarkably **good performance on the utterance rewriting task.** The trained utterance rewriter can be easily integrated into online chatbots and brings **general improvement over different domains.**
